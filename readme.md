Are We Alone? by Fiona
======================

This is [my entry for Ludum Dare 22](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=150) it was created in whole in 48 hours.

It's a moody little planetary exploration game inspired mostly by Star Control. It doesn't have the same humour as Star Control and in fact gives more of a sense of hopelessness and loneliness than anything else.
Saying that, it is possible to finish it, the game is hand crafted rather than randomly generated.

I have put it on Github for posterity, it's under MIT. I'm unlikely to ever touch the game in future, it's also here because Iwan asked for it. :P

Production 
==========

It's written in Python with Pygame and PyOpenGL. It uses a little library/framework that I wrote called Myrmidon, a working version of which is included in this repository.

The graphics were drawn in The GIMP.

The music and sound effects were done in Propellerhead's Reason.
